## Current Features
- RPC (Remote procedure Call) based communication for easy addition of new functionallity
- Automatic upx leads to client binaries of ~6MB with embedded Tor
- the ToRAT_client communicates over TLS encrypted RPC proxied through Tor with the ToRat_server (hidden service)
	- [x] anonymity of client and server
	- [x] end-to-end encryption
- Cross Platform reverse shell (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)
- Windows:
	- Multiple User Account Control Bypasses (Privilege escalation)
	- Multiple Persistence methods (User, Admin)
- Linux:
	- Multiple Persistence methods (User, Admin)
- optional transport without Tor e.g. Use Tor2Web, a DNS Hostname or public/ local IP
	- [x] smaller binary ~7MB upx'ed
	- [ ] anonymity of client and server
- embedded Tor
- Unique persistent ID for every client
	- give a client an Alias
	- all Downloads from client get saved to ./$ID/$filename
- sqlite via gorm for storing information about the clients
- client is obfuscated via [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble)
